        <h3>I am a Graphic designer</h3>
        I studied architecture and interior design at school in Tokyo and worked at a company that did 
        new business planning,<br>product development, and urban planning.<br>
        After becoming independent, I coordinated film and television coverage, product development,<br>
        and graphic design.<br> Then, Five years ago, I moved to Ottawa with my family.<br><br>
        In Ottawa, I was starting from scratch. <br>
        I design newsletters, signs, logos, etc. as a volunteer,but I would like to turn it into a job. <br>
        I decided to study here because I wanted to learn more about web design.<br>
        This is a <em>big challenge</em> for me, who already has design experience.

            <h3>My favorite quart is</h3>
            <blockquote><strong>Less is More</strong>
            <cite>- Mies van der Rohe -</cite></blockquote><br>
            This is a quote that I learned when I studied architecture at school.<br>
            This is the origin of my design and my way of life.
