        I moved to Ottawa with my family from Tokyo, Japan, about five years ago.
        I studied architecture and interior design at school and worked at a company that did 
        new business planning, product development, and urban planning. 
        After becoming independent, I coordinated film and television coverage, product development, 
        and graphic design. I want to study web design, get a diploma, and work in Ottawa.
