        Five years have passed since I came to Ottawa from Tokyo.<br>
        I studied architecture and interior design at school in Tokyo and worked at a company that did 
        new business planning,<br>product development, and urban planning.<br>
        After becoming independent, I coordinated film and television coverage, product development,<br>
        and graphic design. I want to study web design, get a diploma, and work in Ottawa.

        <p><font face="arial,helvetica">My favorite quart is
            <blockquote><strong>Less is More</strong>
            <cite>– Mies van der Rohe -</cite></blockquote><br><br>
            This is a quote that I learned when I studied architecture at school.<br>
            This is the origin of my design and my way of life.
