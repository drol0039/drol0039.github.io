        I moved to Ottawa with my family from Tokyo, Japan, about five years ago.<br>
        I studied architecture and interior design at school and worked at a company that did 
        new business planning, product development, and urban planning. <br>
        After becoming independent, I coordinated film and television coverage, product development, <br>
        and graphic design. I want to study web design, get a diploma, and work in Ottawa.

            <blockquote><strong>Less is More</strong></blockquote> 
            <cite><em>– Mies van der Rohe -</em></cite><br>
            This is a quote that I learned when I studied architecture at school.<br>
            This is the origin of my design and my way of life.
